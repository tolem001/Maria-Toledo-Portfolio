# About Me

I recently completed the Master of Data Science program at Bellevue University. I have been a Cast Member at the Disneyland Resort for 35 years, and I currently serve as a System Analyst supporting IBM Maximo. Outside of work, I’m a proud parent of two children—a daughter who is a nurse and a son who is a senior in high school.

I enjoy working in data science and have experience in supervised modeling, clustering, fairness analysis, and the ethical evaluation of machine learning systems. I have hands-on experience with Python, R, Power BI, cloud platforms, and statistical modeling, and I especially enjoy transforming complex technical data into clear visualizations that help stakeholders make informed decisions.
