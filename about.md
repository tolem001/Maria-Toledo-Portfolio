# About Me

I am a data scientist with experience in supervised modeling, clustering, fairness analysis, and the ethical evaluation of machine learning systems. I have hands-on experience with Python, R, Power BI, cloud platforms, and statistical modeling, and I enjoy translating complex analytical findings into clear, actionable insights for stakeholders.

My recent work includes biomechanical injury analysis in basketball athletes and a fairness‑focused survival prediction model using the Titanic dataset. I am passionate about responsible AI, transparency, and building models that are not only accurate but equitable.
