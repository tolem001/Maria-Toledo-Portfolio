# Welcome to My Portfolio

Thanks for visiting my portfolio! I’m Maria, a system's analyst and a data scientist with a passion for uncovering insights, improving systems, and using data to support better decision‑making. I enjoy working across supervised modeling, clustering, fairness analysis, and the ethical evaluation of machine learning systems.

My background blends decades of real‑world operational experience with advanced analytical training, giving me a unique perspective on how data can meaningfully improve processes, people’s experiences, and organizational outcomes.

Explore my projects, learn more about my journey, and feel free to connect.
