# Welcome to My Portfolio

Hi, I’m Maria — a data scientist focused on supervised modeling, clustering, fairness analysis, and ethical evaluation of machine learning systems. I enjoy transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights and building models that are both accurate and responsible.

This portfolio highlights my background, selected projects, and ways to connect with me. Feel free to explore!
